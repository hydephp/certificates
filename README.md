# HydePHP Certificates

Official HydePHP Certificates and Public Keys

## About

This repository is essentially a mirror of the https://trustservices.hydephp.com/certificates directory, however, it is handled independently of the trust services platform, meaning that two separate platforms would need to be compromised to spoof the key.

Additionally, all public keys are pushed to the following keyservers:
- [OpenPGP Keyserver](https://keys.openpgp.org/)
- [Ubuntu Keyserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/)
- [MIT Keyserver](https://pgp.mit.edu/)
