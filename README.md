# HydePHP Certificates

Official HydePHP Certificates and Public Keys

## About

This repository is essentially a mirror of the https://trustservices.hydephp.com/certificates directory.
This repository is handled independently of the trust services platform, meaning that the two separate platforms would need to be compromised to spoof the a key.

Additionally, all public keys are pushed to the following keyservers:
- [OpenPGP Keyserver](https://keys.openpgp.org/)
- [Ubuntu Keyserver](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/)
- [MIT Keyserver](https://pgp.mit.edu/)
